The 55mm_post_15x2magnet file is used in place of the standard 55mm post from jubilee (the piece that has the 60mm dowels pressed in).  You need one of these and two 15mm x 2mm round magnets.

The Wing Magnet Holder Minimum file is attached to either side of the tool plate.  There are 4 M3 6mm flathead screws holding the wings on the tool plate.  The top two need to be replace with M3 10mm buttonhead screws to hold this magnet wing adapter on. I also used M3 washers.  These take two 10MM x 2mm round magnets.

I glued the magnets in with super glue.

Seem to make tool changes much smoother.  No droopy tools
