3D Printed items neede:
1 55mm_post_15x2magnet.stl 
2 Wing Magnet Holder Minimum.stl
4 M3 button head screw 10mm length
4 M3 washers (optional, but they help)
2 15mm x 2mm round magnets
2 10mm x 2mm round magnets
Super Glue

The 55mm_post_15x2magnet file is used in place of the standard 55mm post from jubilee (the piece that has the 60mm dowels pressed in).  You need one of these and two 15mm x 2mm round magnets.

The Wing Magnet Holder Minimum file is attached to either side of the tool plate.  You need two of these and two 10mm x 2mm round magnets. There are 4 M3 6mm flathead screws holding the wings on the tool plate.  The top two need to be replace with M3 10mm buttonhead screws to hold this magnet wing adapter on. I also used M3 washers

I glued the magnets in with super glue.  Make sure each pair of magnets (one 15mm and one 10mm) are glued in with proper polarity.  The sides that you can see on both peices should attract.

Seem to make tool changes much smoother.  No droopy tools
